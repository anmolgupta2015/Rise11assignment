# Dashboard Replication Assignment

# Introduction
This project is a replication of the provided dashboard design using React.js. The goal is to create a responsive and functional dashboard that matches the original design.

# Approach
To complete this assignment, I followed these steps:

1. Carefully examined the provided dashboard design to understand the layout, components, and functionality.
2. Set up a new React.js project using Create React App.
3. Designed and implemented the dashboard layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
4. Created modular components for reusability, including the navigation menu, progress bar, and input fields.
5. Implemented form validation using React Hook Form.
6. Added dynamic elements, such as checkboxes, dropdowns, and file upload buttons.
7. Tested the dashboard for responsiveness and functionality across different screen sizes.

# Challenges and Solutions
- One of the challenges I faced was replicating the exact design of the progress bar. To solve this, I used CSS pseudo-elements to create the progress bar's visual effects.
- Another challenge was implementing form validation without using external libraries. I solved this by using React Hook Form's built-in validation features.

# Assumptions
- I assumed that the dashboard's layout and design should be replicated as closely as possible.
- I assumed that the form validation should prevent empty submissions and provide feedback to the user.

# Technologies Used
- Frontend Framework: React.js
- Styling: CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS pseudo-elements
- Form Validation: React Hook Form
